# Missing Check
Prophet: Predicting Risks and Recommending Repairs of Detected Missing Checks for Eliminating Potential Vulnerability

# Prophet
A lightweight detection, risk prediction, and repair recommendation system for missing checks aimed at improving the quality and security of software project under development: it detects missing checks accurately
based on a universal static taint analysis framework implemented by ourselves; predicts the risk degree of missing checks using machine learning algorithms based on their contexts and a predictive model; and
recommends repair references based on the context features and a refined data set of precondition checks built from the project itself.
